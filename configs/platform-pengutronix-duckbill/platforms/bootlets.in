	  Build a kernel bootlet and create a bootstream just starting a the

config BOOTLETS_DEBUG
	bool
	prompt "Noisy bootlets"
	help
	  Make the bootlets more noisy. This will output various debug messages
	  at the debug port (UART1 at the Starterkit-5).

config BOOTLETS_MOBILESDRAM
	bool
	prompt "configure for mobile SDRAM"
	help
	  If some kind of mobile SDRAM is in use, enable this entry. Note: The
	  "chumby one" uses a generic DDR SDRAM.

config BOOTLETS_CPU_T1
	bool
	prompt "Second Silicon"
	help
	  CPUs marked with 'TO1.1 PCIMX287CJM4A' (first silicon) need a
	  different encryption method than the ones marked with
	  'TO1.2 PCIMX287CJM4B' (second silicon). Say 'Y' here
	  if you want to create a bootlet for a second silicon CPU.

config BOOTLETS_ENCRYPT
	bool
	prompt "support encryption"
	help
	  Enabling this entry will encrypt the bootstream. Some i.MX28 based
	  platforms only booting encrypted bootstream images (like the
	  "i.MX28 EVK"). Other platforms (like the "chumby one") only booting
	  unencrypted bootstream images.

	bool
	prompt "zeroed key"
	help
	  Enabling this entry will encrypt the bootstream content with a zerod
	  key. Some platforms (like the "i.MX28 EVK") need this special kind
	  of key.

config BOOTLETS_KEY_ENCRYPT
	bool
	prompt "defined key"
